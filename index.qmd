### Alba Refoyo Martinez
##### **Data science and reproducible research for every lab, every system** 
&nbsp;

I'm **Alba**, a **data scientist** at the Health Data Science Center at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/). I have a background in biomedicine and bioinformatics, with a focus on large-scale genomics and omics data analysis. I’ve always been passionate about research and human health, and over the years, my experience in research has shown me the importance of reproducibility and transparency. Today, my work centers on building reproducible pipelines and tools that make data analysis easier, more transparent, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), ensuring they can be deployed across different HPC systems and even locally, helping make data science not only efficient but also equitable and trustworthy.

Beyond development, I’m deeply invested in sharing knowledge—I run workshops, provide consultations, and collaborate with researchers to help them make their analyses work reliably across different academic HPC environments, improving reproducibility and efficiency in their projects.

Want to know more about me? You can find my full [CV](./cv.qmd), a more detailed look at what I do [day-to-day](./projects.qmd), as well as [publications](./publications.qmd) to explore my research work.
