I spend most of it building and testing training modules, working on containerized apps, and helping researchers run their data analysis more smoothly ‚Äî especially on HPC systems.\nThat means writing code, creating example workflows, troubleshooting environments, and turning all of that into hands-on materials others can actually learn from. I also run workshops and help maintain the infrastructure behind our training platform, making sure everything stays up-to-date and reproducible. All materials I create ‚Äî from workshops to web-based exercises ‚Äî are freely available on the project‚Äôs website.\n\nTraining modules & Apps - What we build in the Sandbox\nAs part of the national Health Data Science Sandbox Project, we create containerized apps and training modules that combine notebooks, coding exercises, and interactive tutorials.
