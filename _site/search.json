    "text": "During my +6 years of experience as a research scientist at the University of Copenhagen, I have developed novel scientific software, written reproducible open-source computational pipelines, and performed mathematical modelling in large genomic datasets. I worked in human population genetics and the ancient DNA field and established fruitful collaborations with research groups of diverse backgrounds across the globe. This period, helped me develop some powerful skills:\n\nData analyst - refining my bioinformatics skills and scientific computing using Python, R, snakemake and conda\nProject management - leading and coordinating several research projects\nCommunication skills - presenting research progress at +5 scientific conferences and producing manuscripts for high-impact journals\nLeadership - mentoring 2 master-level students\nEvent management - organising the logistics for +100 Scientists at a Danish conference, activities during the lab retreat for my research centre and a one-day PhD event for the GLOBE Institute\n\n\nResearch articles\nI have presented my research progress at +5 scientific conferences and produced manuscripts for high-impact journals.
