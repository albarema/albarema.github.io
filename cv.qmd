## 🌐 **Interests**
- **Health Data Science**  
- **Population Genomics**  
- **Research Data Management**  

These areas drive my passion for developing innovative, reproducible, and open solutions that help the scientific community. I sam committed to creating open-access, community-driven projects where knowledge and tools are shared freely.


## 🧑‍🏫 **Teaching & Training**

I am currently involve in teaching **PhD students and researchers** practical aspects of:  

- **Pipeline development** (Snakemake, Nextflow)  
- **Software management** (Git, Docker, Conda, GitHub)  
- **HPC concepts** (High-Performance Computing)  
- **Genomics**  
- **Transcriptomics**
- **Research Data Management (RDM)**  

#####  Past Teaching Engagements

- **Analysis of large-scale datasets**: PhD course - 2021
- **Interaction design (KOMIT)’ on the interaction and usability of user interfaces**: Bachelor course - 2019 

**My teaching philosophy**: I emphasize hands-on, project-based learning, where researchers actively engage with the tools they will use in their day-to-day work. I believe in breaking down complex concepts into simple, manageable parts and gradually building on them to promote deeper understanding and confidence.

## 🤝  Volunteer tasks 

I have participated in several event organizing, supporting the planning and coordination of scientific workshops, seminars, and community initiatives.

## 🌍 **About Me**
Beyond my professional work, I have a deep appreciation for nature and find peace in hiking. In 2010, I had the opportunity to take part in an exceptional educational and cultural exchange project called [*The Ruta Quetzal*](https://www.rutaquetzal.com/), which sparked my passion for hiking. My love for travel sparks my curiosity, allowing me to explore diverse cultures and gain new perspectives.
