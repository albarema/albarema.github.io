# My research career 

During my +6 years of experience as a research scientist at the University of Copenhagen, I have developed novel scientific software, written reproducible open-source computational pipelines, and performed mathematical modelling in large genomic datasets. I worked in human population genetics and the ancient DNA field and established fruitful collaborations with research groups of diverse backgrounds across the globe. This period, helped me develop some powerful skills:

- Data scientist - refining my bioinformatics skills and scientific computing using Python, R, snakemake, nextflow, docker and conda
- Project management - leading and coordinating several research projects
- Communication skills - presenting research progress at +5 scientific conferences and producing manuscripts for high-impact journals
- Leadership - mentoring 2 master-level students during my PhD
- Event management - organising the logistics for +100 Scientists at a Danish conference, activities during the lab retreat for my research centre and a one-day PhD event for the GLOBE Institute

## Research articles

I have presented my research progress at +5 scientific conferences and produced manuscripts for high-impact journals. Here you can find a summary of the papers I have contributed to: 

- **Faster Model-Based Estimation of Ancestry Proportions** [@santander2024faster]: efficient software for inferring ancestry proportions 
- **Circumpolar Population Structure, Diversity and Recent Evolutionary History of the Bearded Seal in Relation to Past and Present Icescapes** [mccarthy2025circumpolar]: identifying highly differentiated genomic regions, which can complement research on health, physiology, and behaviour‚Äîkey areas for informing conservation strategies for this species
- **Elevated Genetic Risk for Multiple Sclerosis Emerged in Steppe Pastoralist Population** [@barrie2024elevated]: tracing disease-associated over thousands of years
- **The selection landscape and genetic legacy of ancient Eurasians** [@irving2024selection]: disease-associated variants identification and trait predictions of ancient humans
- **Population Genomics of Post-Glacial Western Eurasia** [@allentoft2024population]: demographic analyses and general population genetics analyses
- **100 ancient genomes show repeated population turnovers in Neolithic Denmark**[@allentoft2024100]: demographic movements and genetic diversity resulting from the Neolithic transition
- **Vittrup Man‚Äìthe Life-History of a Genetic Foreigner in Neolithic Denmark** [@fischer2024vittrup]: trait predictions of nordic ancient individuals 
- **How Robust Are Cross-Population Signatures of Polygenic Adaptation in Humans?** [@refoyo2021robust]: GWAS robustness and portability to other ancestries
- **Identifying Loci Under Positive Selection in Complex Population Histories** [@refoyo2019identifying]: graph-based identification of genomic variants 

## Early scientific career 

Before joining the University of Copenhagen, I gained my first research experience through projects that sparked my curiosity and inspired me to become a scientist. These early experiences played a key role in shaping my passion for research and set me on the path toward a career in bioinformatics.
